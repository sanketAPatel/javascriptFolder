        Greek mathematicians took a special interest in numbers that are equal to the sum of their proper divisors
         (a proper divisor of n is any divisor less than n itself).
         They called such numbers perfect numbers. For example, 6 is a perfect number because it is the sum of 1, 2, and 3, 
         which are the integers less than 6 that divide evenly into 6.
          Similarly, 28 is a perfect number because it is the sum of 1, 2, 4, 7, and 14.
        Write a predicate function isPerfect(n) that returns true if the integer n is perfect, and false otherwise. 
        Test your implementation by writing a program that uses the isPerfect function to check for perfect numbers in the range 1 to 9999 by testing each number in turn. Whenever your program identifies a perfect number, it should display that number on the screen. The first two lines of output should be 6 and 28. Your program should find two other perfect numbers in that range as well.

            if(num % i == 0){
                sum += i;
            }
        }

        if(sum== num){
          document.write(num +"<br>");
        }
        num=num+1;
    }
