<p> This condition, however, can be simplified considerably by squaring each side of the inequality,
     which yields the following more efficient test:<br><br>

                            "x2+y2 < 1"
    If you perform this simulation many times and compute what fraction of the darts falls inside the circle,<br>
     the result will be an approximation of pi/4.<br>
    
    Write a program that simulates throwing 10,000 darts and then uses the results to display an <br>
    approximate value of . Don’t worry if your answer is correct only in the first few digits. <br>The strategy used in this problem is not particularly accurate,<br> 
    even though it occasionally proves useful as an approximation technique. In mathematics, this technique is called Monte Carlo integration, after the capital city of Monaco, famous for its casinos. </p><br><br><br><br>
